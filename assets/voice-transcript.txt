Janny, buenos días. It’s me.
I was thinking about the first time you told me ‘te amo’ — I still feel that moment.
I love how you get up for your mornings, how you take care of yourself, and how you laugh at the smallest things.
I know you worry about age and distance, pero quiero que sepas que I choose you every day.
I can’t wait to be there, to take you on dates, to kiss your hands and your cheeks.
Until then, this small page is for you.
Te amo, mi reina.
